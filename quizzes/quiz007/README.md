# Quiz 007: Create a program that create 10 random password with digits and letters of length 20. [HL]  Ask the user for the length and if symbols should be included. Print answer in RED

I misunderstood the quiz a little bit and what I did is significantly harder but it was fun. I was supposed to compare nth element from list one with nth element of list two but I compared first element of a list with the second and so forth.

Here are the results of the test cases. [10,30,10,26, 20,15,5,-6]
