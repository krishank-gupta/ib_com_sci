#quiz 001

Black Box: Describe a program that  produces the output shown with the input provided.

Solution: the program takes in an input in the form of a string. If any other input type is entered, it is returned as it is. If string is entered, the output is the form "first character, [length of string -2], last character." If string contains multiple words, each word follows output form and output will consist of two outputs following the same pattern.
