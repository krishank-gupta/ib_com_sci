# Task 1

Save your program in a file called task1.md. In a school there are 2400 students and each student uses one locker. Each locker has a unique number from 1 to 2400. The lockers are to be painted in four colors: red, white, yellow and blue, in order of locker numbers, as shown in the following table.link

| Locker Number |  1  |   2   |   3  |    4   |  5  | ... | 2400 |
|:-------------:|:---:|:-----:|:----:|:------:|:---:|:---:|:----:|
|     Color     | red | white | blue | yellow | red | ... | blue |

The pattern of colors continues in this manner. For example, locker number 15 will be painted yellow.

# Task 1: Create a program and the flow diagram that shows the colors of all the lockers from 1 to 2400
