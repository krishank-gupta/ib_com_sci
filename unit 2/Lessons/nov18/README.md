In this lesson we learned about APIs, dictionaries 

I already knew about APIs because I am a web developer and I have worked with JavaScript a lot. Dr. Ruben introduced an API from the school's weather station. I tried a GET request from the API Link Dr. Ruben provided but I got a 500 error. He told me that I need authorization to access the API.
