# Unit One Reflection

### What worked well during unit 1?
Unit One taught the basics of programming in Python language. The basics included concepts like conditions, loops, functions, data types, etc. Since I have been coding for about 5 years now, I was familiar with these concepts. Because of this, the first unit was very easy for me.

I was given a chance to try Codingame instead of Snakify. Codingame helped me practice by solving programming puzzles instead of learning the basic concepts in Snakify that I already knew. Codingame was a lot of fun and challenging for me so I really loved it.

### What did not work well?
I ended up procrastinating a lot on my Com Sci work including quizzes but specially the project. This made my work to pile up and I had to do a lot of it in very little time. 

### What did you enjoy the most during project unit 1?
I most enjoy doing the quizzes in the beginning of all classes.

### What talent have you discovered or practices during this unit?

### What is working well in Computer Science for you?

### What can Dr. Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
