# Quiz 024: Create a program shows the graph of the parabola for 100 values of x in the interval -10 < x < 10. $(y = 2 * {(x + 5)}^2 )$

This quiz was similar to the last one but with the equation changed. I struggled a bit because I forgot that exponents are done using '**'. I kept trying '^' and kept getting the wrong answer but couldn't figure out what was going wrong for a solid 2-3 minutes.
