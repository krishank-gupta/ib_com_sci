<!-- **Fig.1** shows the system diagram for the proposed solution (**SL**). The indoor variables will be measured using an Arduino microprocessor and the sensor DHT11 conencted to the local computer (Laptop) located inside a room. The outdoor variables will be requested to the remote server using a GET request to the API of the server at ```192.168.6.147/readings```. The local values are stored in a CSV database locally. -->

**Fig.2** shows the system diagram for the proposed solution (**HL**). The indoor variables will be measured using a Raspberry PI and four DHT11 sensors located inside a room. Four sensors are used to determine more precisely the physical values and include measurement uncertainty. The outdoor variables will be requested to the remote server using a GET request to the API of the server at ```192.168.6.147/readings```. The local values are stored in a CSV database locally and POST to the server using the API and TOKEN authentication. A laptop computer is used for remotely controlling the local Rasberry Pi using a Dekptop sharing application (VNC Viewer). (Optional) Data from the local raspberry is downloaded to the laptop for analysis and processing.
