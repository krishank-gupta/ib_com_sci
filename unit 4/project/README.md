## Criteria A

### Problem Definition

I am a high school student at an International Baccalaureate School and for my Creativity, Activity, and Service project, I am working on improving education in Nepal. I need more funds to invest in my project and have to find alternate sources of funding. I have a limited reach and do not have any means to connect to people beyond my family, friends, and school. I have tried traditional fundraising methods but they have been time-consuming and have proven to be ineffective in securing enough funds. When talking to a friend working on a similar innovative idea, they told me that they couldn't find potential donors and had no way of knowing how many people are interested in their project (See appendix #1 for transcript). Furthermore, there is no way of knowing how many projects/NGOs are in a community and how they are doing that does not violate the privacy of these projects/NGOs.  

I have tried to secure funds by reaching out to family and friends, selling drinks at markets, selling items in garage sales, etc, but these efforts have not been effective in securing enough funds. This method is very time consuming and has a limited reach, which means I am not able to connect with potential donors beyond my immediate network. Additionally, this method does not provide a convenient way for donors to find projects/NGOs that interest them and donate, which discourages them from contributing to the different projects/NGOs.

### Proposed Solution

My proposed solution is to create an online crowdfunding platform to connect potential donors with projects/NGOs they might be interested in donating to with. I suggest to use Flask as it is a suitable lightweight web framework that is easy to use, flexible, highly customizable, and can be intergrated with several technologies and tools that are rev

Flask is a suitable web framework for building a crowdfunding platform for educational projects and NGOs in Nepal. Flask is a lightweight web framework that is easy to use, flexible, and can be integrated with several technologies and tools that are relevant to the proposed solution.

### Success Criteria

1. __Clear categorization__: The website should clearly categorize charities based on their respective fields, such as education, health, poverty alleviation, and animal welfare, to help users find charities that align with their interests.
2. __Search functionality__: The website should provide a search functionality that allows users to search for charities by category, name, or location, making it easier to find relevant charities.
3. __Device optimization__: The website should be optimized for all devices, ensuring that users can access and use the site on their smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
4. __Like button__: The website should offer a like button that lets users express their support for a charity and see the number of likes a charity has received.
5. __Charity metrics__: The website should provide charities with measurable metrics, such as the number of likes, profile views, and donate page clicks, to help them track their performance and make informed decisions.
6. __Site metrics__: The website should provide measurable metrics to the admin regarding the number of charities listed, number of monthly visits, number of visits and number of donate button clicks of each charity.
