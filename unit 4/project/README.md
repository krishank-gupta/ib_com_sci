## Criteria A

### Problem Definition

I am a high school student at an International Baccalaureate School and for my Creativity, Activity, and Service project, I am working on improving education in Nepal. I need more funds to invest in my project and have to find alternate sources of funding. I have a limited reach and do not have any means to connect to people beyond my family, friends, and school. I have tried traditional fundraising methods but they have been time-consuming and have proven to be ineffective in securing enough funds. When talking to a friend working on a similar innovative idea, they told me that they couldn't pursue their project due to the lack of funds.

I have tried to secure funds by reaching out to family and friends, selling drinks at markets, selling items in garage sales, etc, but these efforts have not been effective in securing enough funds. This method is very time consuming and has a limited reach, which means I am not able to connect with potential donors beyond my immediate network. Additionally, this method does not provide a convenient way for donors to donate, which discourages potential donors from contributing to the project.
